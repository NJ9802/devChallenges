## Overview

![screenshot](Screenshot.jpeg)

Hi everyone! I would like to share my solution to the Github Jobs challenge. You can check out the live demo at this [Link](https://devchcountryquiz.surge.sh/). In this project I learned how to work with React Query from Tanstack. I also learned how to pass information through UrlSearchParams Web API and how to work with the new Route Handlers from NextJS App Router. I had to think of a way to work with an API provider that offers very few requests for the free plan. All of these challenges made me grow as a Web Developer and improve my development skills.
